SFS Update - A script to synchronise from http://www.stopforumspam.com
----------------------------------------------------------------------

About
-----
This script downloads the file from SFS, does some treatment, inserts it in the database, remove the duplicate entries, and that's all

Requirements
------------
- bash
- wget
- grep
- sed
- mysql client and server
- zcat
- getopt
- date
- eval
- gawk
- and of course, a phpbb database installed.

Installation
------------
- Give the correct rights in order to execute the sfs_update script (usually a "chmod u+x sfs_update" should do the trick)

Usage
-----
- Without arguments, he will be in Interactive mode.
- The -H/--hotmail argument : Don't include the *@hotmail.* ban lines, which (if included) doesn't allow users using a hotmail address to register into your forum
- The -I/--interactive argument : Ask questions instead of reading a connect string
- When the -I and the -s arguments are specified, the -I argument has the priority, and the connect string won't be used.

The connect string
------------------
- The -s/--connectstring argument : It takes a formatted string "prefix:user:password@hostname:database:forum_engine".
For example : "phpbb_:forumadmin:my_password@dbserver:myforum:phpbb2" will try to connect with the user "forumadmin", with the password "my_password" on the database named "myforum" of a PHPBB 2 forum on the server "dbserver" and with the tables prefix "phpbb_".
  You can specify more servers, simply separate the connect strings with a space. Exemple: "phpbb_:forumadmin:my_password@dbserver:myforum:phpbb2 forum_:admin:passwd@server2:phpbb:phpbb3"

Here is a list of the forum engines and their "keyword" for the connect string :
PHPBB 2 : phpbb2
PHPBB 3 : phpbb3

Examples
--------

Update a PHPBB 2 database without including the @hotmail ban lines: 
	sfs_update -H -s "forum_:admin:passwd@server2:phpbb:phpbb2"

The same as above, but with long arguments:
	sfs_update --hotmail --connectstring="forum_:admin:passwd@server2:phpbb:phpbb2"

Use the interactive mode:
	sfs_update -I
	or
	sfs_update --interactive
